# 🔊 Voice Biometric Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **biometric voice recognition system** that combines:
- 🎤 **Speaker Recognition** – Identify speakers based on their voiceprints  
- 🐦 **Bird Sound Recognition** – Detect bird calls for biodiversity monitoring  
- 📝 **Transcription, Gender & Emotion Recognition** – Convert speech to text and classify gender & emotion  

The system leverages **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** models for voice-based biometric applications.
